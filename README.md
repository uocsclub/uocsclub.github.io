## Introduction



## Running Locally

Currently, our site is just basic http server.  As long as your computer
can run a web server, you can test the site.  Here are a few examples.

If you have Python 3

```bash
cd uocsclub.github.io
python -m http.server 8000
```

If you have Python 2

```bash
cd uocsclub.github.io
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then check out your [local server](http://localhost:8000).

We may switch to using a templating engine for our site, if needed.  When
we do, we will update this page.
