	<h3>Birds:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Mockingbird: Mx = xx</li>
		<li>Kestrel: Kxy = x</li>
		<li>Identity: Ix = x</li>
		<p>(for all birds x, y)</p>
	</ul>

	<h3>Definitions:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fond: A is fond of B if AB = B</li>
		<li>Egocentric: A is fond of itself</li>
		<li>Agree: A and B agree on a bird x if Ax = Bx</li>
		<li>Agreeable: A is agreeable if given any B, there exists a bird x on which A and B agree</li>
		<li>Compatible: A and B are compatible if there exist x and y where Ax = y and By = x</li>
		<li>Happy: A is happy if it is compatible with itself</li>
		<li>Normal: A is normal if it is fond of at least one bird</li>
		<i>Very useful: in a forest with a Mockingbird and where the composition condition holds, every bird is normal</i>
		<li>Fixation: A is fixated on B if for every bird x, Ax = B</li>
		<li>Hopelessly egocentric: A is hopelessly egocentric if it is fixated on itself</li>
		<li>Left cancellation law for kestrels: if Kx = Ky then x = y</li>
	</ul>
