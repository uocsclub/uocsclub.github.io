	<h3>Definitions:</h3>
	<table>
		<tr> <td>Fond</td> <td>A is fond of B if AB = B</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Egocentric</td> <td>A is fond of itself (ie AA = A)</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Agree</td> <td>A and B agree on a bird x if Ax = Bx</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Agreeable</td> <td>A is agreeable if given any B, there exists a bird x on which A and B agree</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Compatible</td> <td>A and B are compatible if there exist x and y where Ax = y and By = x</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Happy</td> <td>A is happy if it is compatible with itself</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Normal</td> <td>A is normal if it is fond of at least one bird <br>
			<i>Very useful: in a forest with a Mockingbird and where the composition condition holds, every bird is normal</i>
		</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Fixation</td> <td>A is fixated on B if for every bird x, Ax = B</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Hopelessly egocentric</td> <td>A is hopelessly egocentric if it is fixated on itself (ie for every bird x, Ax = A)</td> </tr>
		<tr> <td>Left cancellation law for kestrels</td> <td>if Kx = Ky then x = y</td> </tr>
