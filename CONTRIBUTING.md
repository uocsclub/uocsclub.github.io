# Contributing

Much like the rest of UOCSClub activities, our website strongly relies on the
creative efforts of its members. We ask that if you are a member of our
club, and you would like to contribute to our site, to read the following
and send us your pull request.

## Basic Instructions

Step one, fork our repo.

Step two, clone the forked repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:<you-username>/uocsclub.github.io
```

Step three, check out our
[issues page](https://github.com/uocsclub/uocsclub.github.io/issues) for an
open issue that you can help with.

Step four, do your thing.

Step five, push your changes and send us a pull request.

## Guidelines

Keep the site static. Little to no JavaScript is preferred.

When creating a new page, please use the following when adding files.

- HTML file `/<page name>.html`
- CSS file `/css/<page name>.html`
- Images files `/images/<page name>/<image name>`
- JS files (if needed) `/js/<page name>.js`

If you are making a new core page of our site (like a Contact Us, Events,
Calender, Join, etc.) then remember to add the main pages navbar.

Here are some useful locations to save you time searching for them:

- `/css/main.scss`: The main CSS file
- `/_layouts/`: Page templates
- `/_includes/`: Header, footer, navbar, etc.
